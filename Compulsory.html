      <h2>Parity check</h2>
      Parity check is used for validation of data after transmission from one media to another,for example,transmitting data from hard disk to RAM or from one computer to another through a computer network.<br>
      There are two types of parity check: <d>Odd parity check</d> and <d>even parity check</d><br>
      <img src="parity-bit.jpg"><br>
      An <d>even parity bit</d> is set to 1 if the number of ones in the binary data is odd so that the total number of ones is even). An <d>odd parity bit</d> is set to 1 if the number of ones in the binary data is even so that the total number of ones is odd.If an odd number of bits in data are changed during transmission, the parity bit will indicate an error in transition has occured. The whole data block must be discarded and re-transmitted. Parity checking is a simple and effective means to validate data in data transmission.
      <h2>Data Verification</h2>
      When data is transcribed from one medium to another, there is always a risk of introducing errors. Data verification is a control used to check whether the inputted data matches that in the source document.
      <h4>Input Data Twice</h4>An operator inputs the data twice and allows the computer system to check the second entry against the first one. It reports any discrepencies and the operator is required to correct the answer manually.<br>When you are going to change the password of your e-mail account, you have to re-enter the password for confirmation.
      <h4>Double Data Entry</h4>Two operators enter the same source document into two different files. The computer compares the two files and reports any discrepencies between them. The discrepencies must be checked and corrected manually.
      <h2>Data Hierachy</h2>
      <table><tr><th>Level</th><th>Description</th><th>Example of usage</th></tr>
          <tr><td>Field</td><td><li>It is the smallest unit of data that can be accessed by a user.</li><li>Represent a specific fact of a record.</li><li>Can be of type: numeric, text, date, Boolean, etc.</li></td><td><li>Telephone number</li><li>Mailing address</li><li>Monthly income</li><li>Marital status</li></td></tr>
          <tr><td>Record</td><td><li>It is a collection of related fields.</li><li>Contain information of one specific entity.</li><li>The data in a key field  can be used to uniquely identify one particular record from the others.</li></td><td><img src="Data_Record.png"></td></tr>

      </table>
      <img src="Record_And_Field.png"><br>A <d>key field</d> is a field that can be used to uniquely identify one specific record from other records. The data in a key field is unique to a specific record. In designing tables in a database, the key field should be carefully specified. A good key field for a particular databse table may be improper for others. For example, the mobile telephone number can be used as a key field for a membership table of a boutique chain. This key field can be used to uniquely identify each member. But it is not the case for a table of personal records of students in a school. The Hong Kong ID Card number or a unique student number may be more appropriate.
      <h2>Database Management System (DBMS)</h2>
      <d>Database management system (DBMS)</d> is a computer program that provide function to:<br><li>manage the database structure</li><li>store, organize and retrieve data in a database</li>
      <table>
      <tr><th>Application of DBMS</th><th>Example</th></tr><tr><td><d>Database server</d></td><td>MySQL, Oracle Enterprise Manager, Microsoft SQM server</td></tr><tr><td><d>Small office and personal use</d></td><td>Microsoft Access, Microsoft Visual FoxPro, FileMaker Pro</td></tr></table>
      <h2>File Access Modes</h2>
      <h4>Sequential Access Mode</h4>In a magnetic tape, data records are stored one by one along the lengthy magnetic strip. The magnetic tape drive has to wind the tape forward or backward until the desired record is just underneath the read/write head before the reading or writing operation can proceed. The seek time is long and unpredictable when records are retrieved randomly. The magnetic tape is not a common medium for storing frequently used data records. It is mainly used for backing up and recovering of database and data files in computer servers.
      <h4>Direct Access Mode</h4>
      The hard disk is the most common storage medium for secondary storage due to ts high reliability, speed and capacity. When data is read from or written to a hard disk, the magnetic disk plate (know as platter) rotates and the read/write head moves across the platter surface at the same time to the location containing the data. It is often used as secondary storage for operating systems, application softwares and data files.
      <h4>Adventage</h4>
      Once the target location is moved underneath the read/write head, the reading or writing process operation can proceed. This way of accessing data is called direct access. The seek time is much shorter and predictable, ranging from 8ms to 20ms. The hard disk is the most essential secondary storage device for a database system and database tables as well as all other computer software.
      <br>Although floppy disks and optical disks like DVD-RAM and CD-RW also operate in direct access mode, they are limited in capacity and speed of data access. They are rarely used as storage media for database systems and frequently used data files.
      <h2>Denary, Binary and Hexadecimal number systems</h2>
      We always use the denary number system in our daily life for counting and calculation. However, since computer systems operate with Boolean logic and represent values in two electronic states, computers use the binary number system for data representations and manipulations. The hexadecimal number system is a common means for a computer to communicate with programmers.
      <h2>Number System Conversions</h2>
      <h4>From Binary to Denary</h4> The binary number 1011<sub>2</sub> = 1 x 2<sup>3</sup> + 0 x 2<sup>2</sup> + 1 x 2<sup>1</sup> + 1 x 2<sup>0</sup><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; = 11<sub>10</sub>
      <h4>Hexadecimal to Denary</h4>The hexadecimal number 2CA9<sub>16</sub> = 2 x 16<sup>3</sup> + 12 x 16<sup>2</sup> + 10 x 16<sup>1</sup> + 9 x 16<sup>0</sup><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;= 11433<sub>10</sub>
      <h4>Use short division to convert numbers into Binary numbers</h4><img src="BinaryConversion.png">
      <h4>Convert Binary numbers into Hexadecimal numbers and vice versa</h4><ol><li>Group the digits of the binary number by four starting from the right hand side.</li><li>Replace each group of four digits by an quivalent hexadecimal digit.</li></ol>10 1011<sub>2</sub><br>
      Step 1: 1001<sub>2</sub> = 9<sub>16</sub><br>Step 2: 1111<sub>2</sub> = F<sub>16</sub><br>
      Therefore, 10011111<sub>2</sub> = 9F<sub>16</sub><br><br>A7<sub>16</sub><br>Step 1: A<sub>16</sub> = 1010<sub>2</sub><br>Step 2: 7<sub>16</sub> = 0111<sub>2</sub><br>Therefore, A7<sub>16</sub> = 1010 0111<sub>2</sub>
      <h2>Number Representation in Computer Systems</h2>The binary number system is the only number system that a computer uses in storing numbers and performing arithmetic. 
      <h4>Bit</h4>A bit is a single binary digit. It is the basic unit for storing data in a computer. With a single bit, any one of two distinct values can be represented, for example, 0 or 1, true or false, and on or off. If more distinct values need to be represented, a series of bits can be used. For example, an 8-bit binary number can represent 2<sup>n</sup> distict values.
      <h4>Byte</h4>A byte is a data unit used in computers. A byte consists of 8 bits and is the smallest addressable unit in a microprocessor.
      <table><tr><th>Unit</th><th>Abbreviation</th><th>Remark</th></tr>
      <tr><td>Bit</td><td>b</td><td>The basic unit of a binary unit</td></tr>
      <tr><td>Byte</td><td>B</td><td>1 B = 8 b</td></tr>
      <tr><td>Kilobyte</td><td>KB</td><td>1 KB = 2<sup>10</sup> B = 1024 bytes</td></tr>
      <tr><td>Megabyte</td><td>MB</td><td>1 MB = 2<sup>20</sup> B = 1024 KB</td></tr>
      <tr><td>Gigabyte</td><td>GB</td><td>1 GB = 2<sup>30</sup> B = 1024 MB</td></tr>
      <tr><td>Terabyte</td><td>TB</td><td>1 TB = 2<sup>40</sup> B = 1024 GB</td></tr></table>
      <h4>Word</h4>Modern computers can handle data stored in two or more bytes at a time. The natural unit of data used by a computer is called a word. The word length, or also known as word size, is measured in bits. Modern computers usually have a word length of 16, 32 or 64 bits. Word size refers to the number of bits processed by a computer's CPU in one go.
      <h4>Representation of Unsigned Binary Integer</h4>Unsigned integer is a type of integer representation that contains no sign symbol. Non-negative numbers such as population and sales volume of books can be represented by unsigned integers.<br>In a computer, when a word is used to store an unsigned binary integer, all bits in a word are used to represent the magnitude.
      <table><tr><th>Word Length</th><th>Minimum unsigned binary integer allowed</th><th>Maximum unsigned binary integer allowed</th></tr><tr><td>4-bit</td><td> 0<sub>10</sub></td><td> 15<sub>10</sub> (2<sup>4</sup> - 1)</td></tr>
          <tr><td>8-bit</td><td>0<sub>10</sub></td><td>255<sub>10</sub> (2<sup>8</sup>-1)</td></tr>
          <tr><td>16-bit</td><td>0<sub>10</sub></td><td>65535<sub>10</sub> (2<sup>16</sup>-1)</td></tr>
          <tr><td>24-bit</td><td>0<sub>10</sub></td><td>16777215<sub>10</sub> (2<sup>24</sup>-1)</td></tr>
      </table>
      <h4>Sign-and-magnitude</h4> The leftmost bit, known as a sign bit, is used to specify the sign of a binary integer. The sign bit is set to 0 for a positive integer while it is set to 1 for a negative integer. The rest of the bits are used to store the magnitude of the binary number.<br>The shortfall of this representation is that there are two representations of zero. Sign-and-magnitude is rarely used in computer systems.
      <table><tr><th>Word Length</th><th>Minimum signed binary integer allowed</th><th>Maximum signed binary integer allowed</th></tr>
      <tr><td>4-bit</td><td>1111<sub>2</sub> = -7<sub>10</sub></td><td>0111<sub>2</sub> = 7<sub>10</sub></td></tr>

          </tr></table>
      <h4>Two's Complement</h4>Two's Complement is widely used in computers to represent binary integers. All integers have unique representations.
      <table><tr><th>Two's Complement</th><td>0111</td><td>0110</td><td>0101</td><td>0100</td><td>0011</td><td>0010</td><td>0001</td><td>0000</td><td>1111</td><td>1110</td><td>1101</td><td>1100</td><td>1011</td><td>1010</td><td>1001</td><td>1000</td></tr>

For a negative binary integer, the two's complement representation can be evaluated.
      <ol><li>Starting from the corresponding positive binary integer, invert all bits from 0 to 1 and 1 to 0. The result is known as one's complement.</li><li>Add 1 to the one's complement to give the representation of two's complement binary number.</li></ol>The above steps can also be used to convert a negative binary number to a positive binary number.
      <table><tr><th>Word Length</th><th>smaller negative binary number allowed</th><th>Largest positive binary number allowed</th></tr>
      <tr><td>4-bit</td><td>1000<sub>2</sub> = -8<sub>10</sub></td><td>0111<sub>2</sub> = 7<sub>10</sub></td></tr>
      <tr><td>8-bit</td><td>1000 0000<sub>2</sub> = -128<sub>10</sub></td><td>0111 1111<sub>2</sub> = 127<sub>10</sub></td></tr>
      </table>
      <h4>Overflow of Unsigned Integers</h4>For a calculation of two integers with fixed digits, an error may occur when the result is outside the range that the digits can represent. This error is called overflow.<br>1111 0000 + 0001 1100 = 1 0000 1100 (overflow)<br>0000 1000 - 0001 1000 = 1111 0000 (negative,therefore overflow)<img src="OverflowUnsignedInteger.jpg">
      <h4>Addition and Subtraction of Two's Complement Numbers</h4>No matter what the sign bits are, the addition of two's complement numbers are exactly the same as the addition of two unsigned binary integers. Overflow erro occurs when two numbers of the same sign are added and the result has the opposite sign.<br>1111 0101 + 0001 0100 = 0000 1001<br>1101 1111 + 1011 1111 = 1001 1110<br>1101 1111 + 1001 1100 = 0111 1011 (overflow)<br><h4>Character Coding Systems</h4>
      Other than numeric data, a computer needs to store and process characters. The character coding system is a way to represent characters in a form that can be manipulated efficiently in a computer.
      <h4>ASCII</h4>American Standard Code for Information Interchange (ASCII) and Extended Binary-Coded Decimal Interchange Code (EBCDIC) are two common character coding systems for computers and some communication devices.Each code represents either a printable character or a non-printable character.<br>Each ASCII character consists of 7 bit and it can contain 2<sup>7</sup> different characters.<br>
      <img src="https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSLTBW_2.3.0/com.ibm.zos.v2r3.ioaq100/ascii_table.gif">
      <h4>Chinese Character System</h4>The standard ASCII contains only 128 characters and the extended ASCII can have 256 characters. They are sufficient for english and Western European languages but are not large enough for Asian languages.There are more than 100000 Chinese characters and we use more than 10000 of them in our daily lives. We need some other character coding systems. Chinese characters are usually represented in Big5 code, Guo Biao (GB) code and unicode systems.<br>Big5 code is mainly used to represent traditional Chinese and is very popular in the Chinese computer systems In Hong Kong, Macau and Taiwan. GB code is the standard code for simplified chinese. Both character coding systems use two bytes to represent one Chinese character. Since these two characters coding systems use different codes to represent the same Chinese characters, if a Chinese text file is processed with the wrong coding system, strange and meaningless characters will appear.
      <h4>Unicode</h4>
      Recently, Unicode has been used extensively to represent all the existing languages in the world. Unicode consists of a repertoire of about 100000 characters. It is an international standard code that sets the codes for commonly used characters in the world, including both traditional and simplified Chinese characters. The representations of Unicode known as code points are variable in length. They are made up of one to four bytes. The code points are carefully defined so that the most frequently used characters, such as the ASCII codes, are put at the front of the code table. As a result, these characters can be represented by a one-byte code point.
